### Composite Pattern 
The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same 
type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

### Decorator Pattern
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside 
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
